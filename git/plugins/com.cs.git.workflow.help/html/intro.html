<h1>A Standard Git Workflow</h1>
<p>This Eclipse feature provides tools to support the adoption of a standard Git workflow.
The Git toolset is an immensely powerful and feature rich toolset; however that power can leave new users a little bewildered.
It can also lead to use of the tool in unorthodox and unusual ways that make team adoption/learning more difficult.
This plugin attempts to make it easy for developers to follow a recognised and established workflow for using Git's powerful features to drive development and continuous integration in a team environment.</p>
<p>The standard workflow is based (almost entirely) on the fantastic work of <a href="http://nvie.com/">Vincent Driessen</a> and is really an attempt to codify and formalise the process he suggested in 
his blog post <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">"A successful Git branching model"</a> (first posted January 2010).</p>
